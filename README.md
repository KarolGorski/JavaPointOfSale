# JavaPointOfSale
I'm programming simple point of sale to show my abilities in oop and join intership :D

Application is very simple, but building it took me too much time.

My point of sale lets you to insert some "barcodes" (String codes) by mocked barcode scanner and check if they are in database("database").
By hitting ESC button on Swing "LCDScreen" or by inserting "exit" into scanner you finish ordering and there is "printed" receipt from "printer".

Nothing more :D
